# UMath
Simple math library (Matrix, Quaternion, UKF) using the MKL library from Intel.

## Installation

The Math Kernel Library (MKL) of Intel need to be installed.

## Usage example

Simply add the header to your project to use it.

## Dependencies
- [MKL](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneMKL)

## Thoughts

Some cleanup needs to be done (separate declaration and definition, and separate Matrix, Quaternion, and UKF features)
